## Get a Missing Number from an array
### Approach: 
  The length of the array is n-1. So the sum of all n elements, i.e sum of numbers from 1 to n can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. 
  Now find the sum of all the elements in the array and subtract it from the sum of first n natural numbers, it will be the value of the missing element.
